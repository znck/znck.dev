# Negative feedback comes from a good place

It's not easy to say negative things to people. In fact, it takes a lot of
courage to point out shortcoming. If someone does that for me, honest and
brutal, I keep them close. Brutal and honest friends are dearest to me.

## Feedback is hard

We used to have 360-degree feedbacks at Myntra (I mean they still have, I am no
more with them but still we). I used to hate those and often treated them waste
of time. When I look back today, I hated because I couldn't write about people
and their work. I couldn't write because it's very difficult to recall what they
did this year and how could I remember their work when I was having hard time
remembering mine. What did I do this year? I have been working on this component past few weeks. And oh! I shipped that feature before that. And... and... what the hell did I do? And you're asking me feedback on your work?

I used to face the same empty wall when I had to ask for feedback. We were
living in now with no recollection of past, very little recollection. This wasn't
working for me and I guess neither for people working with me, I feel they even
didn't know that we weren't a good team. The first 360-feedback was a disaster, I
didn't write anything, about me or my work or them or their work, nothing at all.

My manager called for an 1-on-1, "Why didn't you fill your self-review?". I
didn't tell him that I didn't remember, "Do we really need to? I mean I working
well, you know that. Isn't it a waste of time?". That day I got to know that
360-feedbacks are precursor to the forthcoming calibration meeting, unknown to
me, these corporate shenanigans, I thought. The calibration meeting was a
hidden championship where every employee was compared with every other in same
role. Hidden because you don't represent yourself, instead your manager
represents you. "But, you know what I have worked on", it struck me, shit—what
the hell would he remember about my work when I couldn't. Maybe subconsciously I
thought he's oracle or something, he would know, I can count on him, go be my
champion and fetch me a promotion. But, it doesn't work like that and I am lucky
I got know this very early in my career.

## It takes courage

I started writing all major task I was working or peers who interacted with
me. It was all one big text note, it had all I needed, what I worked on, what
they worked on, if found something wrong in their work or their behavior, I
did keep a note of everything important. It helped me in 1-on-1s to set my
goals, to steer myself into a kind of position I wanted.

Today when I look back, I feel I didn't do justice to my peers. I didn't tell
them in time, I waited for the 360-feedback because I had content, I could write
this time and I did write. But that feedback was useless, it was late by 6
months, they couldn't do anything then, even if they eagerly wanted to do
something. I set them up for failure. I did. But what else could I do, I didn't
know you're supposed to tell people, nobody told me. Nobody asked me for
feedback, no before the D-day. And I didn't have the courage to tell them
unasked for. I takes courage to give feedback, even more when unasked for.

## We react badly to negative feedback

If someone points out your mistakes or failure, it's natural that you would
get in a defensive position. We try to divert, come up with excuses—"I wanted
to write test cases but you know deadline was so harsh, I could barely complete
the task itself.", guess what the task is still incomplete and whatever you
say to in defense of a negative feedback, it's always what it is—a defense, an excuse, a diversion.

Acceptance, or a question is a good response. Question, in fact, is the best
response—"I feel that's true, I think I have underestimated the task, how could
I have done this better?". Ask question, get more information, get actionable
feedback. And keep telling your head, she is trying to help me, be rational, be
reasonable, open to suggestions and don't shut her off, listen, listen, listen
and ask.

## Not taking personally is a superpower

"That's not a good way to do it, it could turn into some serious performance
issue".

We attach ourselves to our work so much that tend to loose where do we
end and where does our work start. An objective comment on a piece of code
can become an attack on my code suddenly. My code, my precious. Keeping oneself
detached from work is a superpower and no one is born with it, neither can one
be bit by a radioactive spider to gain it. You have to practice, practice in
face of every criticism, every negative feedback that listen, listen, listen and ask. She is talking about this code and not me, there could be some merit in her
suggestion, I should stay open to ideas.

"I thought due to these constraints, we have a reasonable upper bound, maybe I
missed something, why do you think it could run into performance issues?"

## Feedback Driven Development

We all want to be better, we aspire to and yet we never ask. Feedback is the
fuel for personal development and you need to ask for it, for you to grow, to be better.

I have learnt something about using feedback as a fuel for personal development,
partly from my experiences and partly from "The Making of a Manager" by Julie
Zhou. I call it FDD, F stands for both—fuckup and feedback, both are necessary
for one's growth. One makes mistakes to be better but needs feedback to learn
from them.
