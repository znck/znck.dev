# Grammarly in Code

Markdown. Code. Grammarly.

There's no simpler writing tool than markdown. There's no elegant editor than VS Code. There's no better writing environment than markdown in code. It's perfect, but whenever I write, I find myself copy-pasting back and forth between Grammarly editor and VS Code editor. Grammarly makes my writing much better, but it also forces me to use their editor. Don't take me wrong I don't hate their editor, in fact, I kind of like it â€” bright, clean, spacious. But it's not sufficient for me as my articles generally have images, code snippets, figures, and sometimes markup. The lack of markdown syntax highlight is absolutely a deal-breaker. If I could make Grammarly work in VS Code editor, wouldn't it be perfect?
