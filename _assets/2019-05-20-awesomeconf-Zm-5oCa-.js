For inspiring talks, for making new friends and meeting old friends, or for learning new things, conferences have been influential in my journey as a developer. I like many conferences, but I want to be in every vue conference. If you been to a vue Conference, then you know that there’s something different about it. The environment is so welcoming and friendly. Sad! I have to travel across the world to be in one. I have longed to see a vue conference in India, my home, for a long time now.</p><p>I decided, I was done waiting! <em>Let’s start a vue conference</em>, I urged Swapnil. He was in. We were ready. But we didn’t have the slightest clue how to. So, we started looking at other conferences. ReactFoo, JSFoo, VueConf, Connect.Tech and VueFes. These conferences are enormous. A lot goes into running them, and that scared me. It was not doable for me, for Swapnil, for a team of two who has been struggling to keep the vue meetup running.</p><p>The dream would have ended there if Sid wasn’t there.</p><p>One evening, Sid dropped something in my Twitter inbox:</p><blockquote><p>Hi! I have a CFP for you. 😅</p></blockquote><p>That random CFP has been very phenomenal for me. Who knew one random message, on the evening of 23rd December 2018, would make a conference organizer one day. Thanks a lot, Sid for the birthday gift!</p><blockquote><p>Hi 👋</p><p>This is random but I&#39;m organizing a tiny react conference on Jan 5</p><p>very few attendees compared to a normal conf (25) and plenty of time between talks to discuss and have conversations</p><p>I realize that&#39;s the part I most enjoy at conferences, so it would be cool to shape the entire conference around it</p><p>would you like to give a talk on vue features that the react community should steal 😁</p><p><a href="https://tinyconf.in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://tinyconf.in</a> (not announced yet)</p></blockquote><p>It was a different kind of CFP — “here’s a topic, you’re speaking on it.” If you know me, you know that I love taking vue to react conferences.
