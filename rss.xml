    <title>Package-First Philosophy</title>
    <link>https://znck.dev/articles/2025-07-02-package-first-philosophy</link>
    <description>
      <![CDATA[
        A year ago, we were facing a common challenge: a sprawling codebase where everything was interconnected. Fixing one issue often broke something else. Refactors felt like high-stakes operations. Code reviews were slow and confusing because no one was clear on ownership. It was a familiar problem, and it was draining.

    <title>Negative feedback comes from a good place</title>
    <link>https://znck.dev/articles/2020-01-14-appreciate-feedback</link>
    <description>
      <![CDATA[
        It's not easy to say negative things to people. In fact, it takes a lot of courage to point out the shortcoming. If someone does that for me, honest and brutal, I keep them close. Brutal and honest friends are dearest to me.

    <title>Shipping Web Components with Vue</title>
    <link>https://znck.dev/articles/2019-11-09-shipping-web-components-with-vue</link>
    <description>
      <![CDATA[
        I have been watching the web component spec. However, all the projects I have worked on were either using Vue or React, and these frameworks are more than capable of building complex applications. I never felt like using web components, but that changed yesterday.

    <title>Grammarly in Code</title>
    <link>https://znck.dev/articles/2019-06-03-grammarly-in-code</link>
    <description>
      <![CDATA[
        There's no simpler writing tool than markdown. There's no elegant editor than code. There's no better writing environment than markdown in code. It's perfect, but whenever I write, I find myself copy-pasting back and forth between Grammarly editor and VS Code editor. Grammarly makes my writing much better, but it also forces me to use their editor. Don't take me wrong I don't hate their editor, in fact, I kind of like it — clean, spacious, and responsive. But it's not sufficient for me as my articles generally have images, code snippets, figures, and sometimes markup. The lack of syntax highlight for markdown and markup is an absolute deal-breaker. If Grammarly worked in VS Code editor, wouldn't that be perfect?

    <title>Running an awesome conference</title>
    <link>https://znck.dev/articles/2019-05-20-awesomeconf</link>
    <description>
      <![CDATA[
        I love attending conferences. For inspiring talks, for making new friends and meeting old friends, or for learning new things, conferences have been influential in my journey as a developer. I like many conferences, but I want to be in every vue conference. If you been to a vue Conference, then you know that there’s something different about it. The environment is so welcoming and friendly. Sad! I have to travel across the world to be in one. I have longed to see a vue conference in India, my home, for a long time now.

    <title>Fiddle with Vue.js</title>

    <description>
      <![CDATA[
        If you’ve created an issue on Vue.js repository for the first time then there is high probability that you skipped reading the contribution guidelines. By doing so you’ve created an issue that does not tell maintainers a thing and helps nobody.
Next, you would be hit with a template response and your issue would be labelled need repro.
